Personal project I am working on to practice using and learn
more about C++ and network and graphics programming. 

I will eventually like to add networking concepts to graphically
display data received over a network. Whether it be bars, trails,
particle displays, who knows as of now. My goal is to just get a
working prototype currently and expand on it gradually.
